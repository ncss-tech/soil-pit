<b><u>Repository for Dave White's DSM scripts and related tools</u></b>   

<b>DSM Tools 1.0.zip</b>   
An ArcGIS toolbox containing common tools used during preprocessing of raster data. Included are quite a few batch processes that work by adding the input and output folders for your raster layers.
   
<b>Random Forest Model</b>   
r script utilizing the caret package to run Random Forest. This script utilizes parallel processing to speed up calculations

Under active development - Still need to finish code for producing probability maps, and some of the code for utilizing RF output to ArcSIE   

<b>cLHS</b>   
A tutorial providing several methods for implementing cLHS.

Will be updating soon to include a section on how to use the Gower's similarity index, developed by Colby Brungard to select replacement points.   

<b>CovariateReduction_v0.1.R</b>   
Several functions to reduce the number of covariates by statistical means.   
Correlation reduction - Creates a correlation matrix and then removes highly correlated covariates.   
Near Zero Variance - Calculates the variance of each covariate and removes the ones that are at or near zero.   
Iterative Principal Component Analysis (iPCA) - Method of iterating through PCAs to reduce the number of covariates down to the ones that account for the majority of the overall population variance.   

<br><b>polypedon_points_v0.3.R</b>   
A method I developed to generate model training points based on the concept of the polypedon.   

<br><b>landsat_indicies.R</b>   
Basic R script for calculating landsat8 indicies.
