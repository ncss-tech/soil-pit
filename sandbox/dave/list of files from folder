Simple way to create a .txt file that contains a list of files found in a directory

Open up a file explorer window
Navigate to and open your covariate folder
In the address bar type: cmd and hit enter- this will open a command prompt in your covariates folder
Then type the following command:
dir /b *tif > listtif.txt 
*note you can change the *tif to whatever file extension your covariates are in
hit enter
if successful this will write the covariate names to a text file located within your covariate folder called listtif.txt

if you are interested in other ways you can use the dir command type dir /? into the command prompt
