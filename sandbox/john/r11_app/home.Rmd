##Tips

* If a menu has multiple sub-menu items, remember to choose a sub-menu item in order to view the results of a query.  The Water Table and Organic Matter menus have both plots and tables in separate sub-menu items.

* Once the sub-menu item is active it will begin loading an example query unless you have already changed the query inputs.

* The submit button can be used to submit another query after the sub-menu item has already been selected.

* This application is viewed best in a browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox

* Wildcards can be used in the project extent query.  Use a percent symbol % for office.  Use an asterisk * for the project name.

* Maximum number of records returned from Soil Data Access is 100,000.

* Project Extent query uses pattern matching.  Anchors (^ or $) may be needed if exact results are needed.

* The Project Report can accept multiple projects.  Use the semicolon (;) as a separator.
